Easy work and result focused thesis/report/etc writing using [LyX](http://lyx.org)- removing much LaTeX learning. http://lyx.org <br/>
please view https://bewketut.github.com/index1.html
and the now updated....https://github.com/bewketut/thesis/
Most Universities these days are crazy giving both put LaTeX and work at the same time. <br/>
What I show you here is how to slow down things a little bit in LaTeX learning 
and work on your topic. I wrote my thesis long time ago literally in two/three weeks.<br/> Instead I worked on my *working* code writing for longer time and finished.

These are files with only front/title pages and bibliography/Referencing LaTeX additions. Yes you can use pure LaTeX in LyX to modify somethings in your document.
